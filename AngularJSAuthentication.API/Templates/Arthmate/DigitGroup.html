        <ol>
            <li>
                If You suffer a Fracture not specified in the below table but the fracture is due to an injury solely and
                directly due to an accident, then Our Medical Practitioner will decide the amount payable, if any.
            </li>
            <li>
                A fracture which results due to any illness or disease (including malignancy) or due to osteoporosis shall not
                be payable under this benefit.
            </li>
            <li>
                A fracture where the broken bone penetrates the skin is an Open Fracture and where the broken bone does
                not penetrate the skin is a Closed Fracture.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the Insured Member suffers Accidental Injuries resulting in more than one fractures, then Our maximum,
                total and cumulative liability under this Benefit shall be limited to the Sum Insured opted by You and
                mentioned in Your Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance against this Section.

            </li>
            <li>
                A fracture which results due to any illness or disease (including malignancy) or due to osteoporosis shall not
                be payable under this benefit.
            </li>
            <li>
                A fracture where the broken bone penetrates the skin is an Open Fracture and where the broken bone does
                not penetrate the skin is a Closed Fracture.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the Insured Member suffers Accidental Injuries resulting in more than one fractures, then Our maximum,

            <p>
                In the event insured gets re-employed but with reduced monthly take-home salary, the Company shall pay 70% of the
                difference between the reduced monthly take-home salary and the monthly take-home salary prior to the insured event.
                This payment is subject to a maximum of the EMI amount and is restricted to the number of months as opted by You
                and mentioned in Your Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The claim payable under this policy shall continue to be paid in a reduced proportion as per the calculation method
                above, even if re-employment takes place during the period of severance pay, or during the deferred period of 30 days,

            </p>
            <h6><strong><u>Initial Waiting Period:</u></strong></h6>

                </li>

                    In addition to the previous point, there will be a further waiting period of one month before the claim payable under
